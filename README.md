# Collatz-conjecture
Validating Collatz conjecture with multithreads.

## Usage
- Compile validator.cpp by GNU G++ with -O3 option.
- Input the interval of integers to be validated, and set the proper number of threads for computation.
- You can use it for benchmark of mutithreads.
- validator_from_one.cpp is a faster version but you need to initial your validation from 1.
